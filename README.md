### USING Member

After install, by default, an icon is placed on the desktop. If you elected to disable this, type **member** in the windows search bar to discover it. Else navigate to the **Artanemus** folder on the start bar. (All SCM applications and utilities are located in this folder.)

### ON START-UP

The application will ask you to login to the database. Currently there is no help file for this application. So I offer you these notes.

Use the navigator to browse, edit, insert and delete members.

Editing can be done in both single and grid view. (TabSheet 1 and TabSheet 2.)

Members that have a swimming data (they have raced an event) cannot be deleted (it would void MS SQL integerity). The correct method is to archive these members.

> Use Windows **Apps and Features** to remove the application.
